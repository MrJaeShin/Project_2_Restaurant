## Technologies Used :

This game uses Javascript, CSS and HTML. HTML is used to create the skeleton of the game. CSS was used for the styles. Javascript was used for user interaction, so that the application reacts to the user's action on the HTML side. 


## Rules for my version of Blackjack : 

Play it here! ==> [GAME](https://mrjaeshin.github.io/Project_1_Blackjack/)

Blackjack is a card game where players play against a dealer. The cards are worth face value, except Aces and face cards (J, Q, K). Aces are 1 or 11, and face cards are each worth 10. The player's goal is to get the sum of their cards higher than the sum of the dealer's cards, without going over 21. Going over 21 for both player and dealer will result in "bust."

The dealer and the players each initially get two cards when player clicks 'DEAL' button.

By clicking the 'HIT' button, the player receives additional card that increases their total score. If the new card puts the player's total over 21 ('BUST'), their turn is automatically over.

If the player thinks that the score is high enough to beat the dealer's score, or they will bust is they hit once more, the player should click 'STAND'. This will end their turn.

The dealer will automatically 'HIT' untll higher than the player's or it results in a bust, and the player win.

## The Making of Blackjack

I have heard through out the course that more time should be put into plaaning, but I realized it now after this project not to start actual coding until the plan makes sense. I struggled alot at the end to debug and add features to my app, because I have not organized the plan. I ran into many walls trying to reorganize the structure of the code. The my version of the game is not even close to the final version of the game that I pictured in my head. I thought too far ahead and I was not able to catch up to my plans.

## Future Enhancements

I'd also like to add more CSS features to enhance the visual design of the game. I could not get over the logics part of the project.

There are few features I originally wanted to add to the game. 

First being betting and player's credit feature.

Second being 'DOUBLE DOWN' feature where the player doubles their original bet to get just one additional card. Ending their turn immediately.

Finally the 'SPLIT' feature where if the player's initial two cards have the same value, they can split those two cards into two separate hands. Each of them get an extra card. Then the player gets to play each hand separately. This feature would also double the player's bet, as each split hand has their own separate bet equal to the player's original bet.
